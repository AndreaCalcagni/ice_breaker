# Ice Breaker

## About The Project
This project is based on Eden Marco's Linkedin Ice Breaker. You can view the original repository at:
[Eden Marco's Ice Breaker](https://github.com/emarco177/ice_breaker)

The Ice Breaker application is a valuable resource for learning LangChain by building a generative AI application. It is a web application designed to crawl LinkedIn data about a person and create a concise summary of their profile. This tool leverages the Langchain agent to crawl Google searches via SerpAPI and scrape the requested LinkedIn profiles using Proxycurl.

The application's primary functions include generating icebreakers and creating summaries for presentations. Additionally, this project is exploring the integration of Hugging Face as an open-source alternative to OpenAI.
